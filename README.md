# World Renderer

I made this for GTace (Growtopia private server).
I wanted to make bot, that will recieve world's data from GTace server and visualize it. In current state it can draw all items in the world, but it can't draw visuals (water, fire, glue, ON/OFF state of block) and weather.
I used here library DevIL (https://github.com/DentonW/DevIL) and library ENet (https://github.com/lsalzman/enet).
I used g++ to compile this. 
This project isn't done, because I chose wrong library for drawing things.
